## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Fork this repository

2. Clone the remote repository into a local environment

3. [Install all dependencies](#dependency)

4. Ensure the Google Maps API is functional

5. Deploy app on localhost

Vue provides a user interface (BETA) that allows deploying the project on an optionally specified port on *localhost:PORT_NUM*. The Vue UI can be accessed by running the command below on the project root:

```
vue ui
```

Otherwise, locally run the app by the following vue commands:

#### Compile the vue application with hot reloading

```
npm run serve
```

#### Compile and minify the vue application for production

```
npm run build
```

#### Run and lint files

```
npm run lint
```

### Running the tests

Unit testing on the project will be done with JEST. JEST can be installed by adding it as a dependency to the project by running the following command:

```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

"--save-dev" ensures that JEST is only required as a dependency during the development stage of the project

Instructions on installing and using JEST can be found on the [original documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started).

## Built With

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) - The web framework used
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/getting-started/) - Map API

### Production Dependencies

The project is a full-stack MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vue, Node) built fully on the Vue framework, 

The project currently requires the following packages as dependencies in order to _deploy_:

> [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/#html) (url routing)

> [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/) (storage management)

> [bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs) (display)

> [vue2-google-maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue2-google-maps) (Google Maps Vue API)

### Additional Dependencies

The project uses [sass-loader](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/pre-processors.html#sass) to compile SASS [node](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) files into readable CSS

<a name="dependency"></a>To install all the dependencies, simply clone the project and run the following command in the project root folder. 

```
npm install
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Google Cloud Platform

Currently, as part of the development stage, the app is running using a public API Key with specific quotas set to prevent too many requests being made to the Google API Services allowed. Therefore, the dotenv (~/.env) environmental variables file is committed into this repository to support ease of contribution by members of the team. In order to obtain a new private API key, feel free to follow the instructions posted on the Original [Google Cloud Platform Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
